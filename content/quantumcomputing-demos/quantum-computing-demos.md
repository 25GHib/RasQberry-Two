# Quantum Computing Demos available in RasQberry

This page lists several Quantum Computing demos that will be made available on RasQberry

## Raspberry Tie

Your Raspberry Pi running code on the IBM Quantum platform processors or simulators via Python 3 -- with results displayed courtesy of the 8x8 LED array on a SenseHat (or SenseHat emulator)!
