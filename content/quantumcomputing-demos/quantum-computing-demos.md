# Quantum Computing Demos available in RasQberry

This page lists several Quantum Computing demos that will be made available on RasQberry

## Raspberry Tie

Your Raspberry Pi running code on the IBM Quantum platform processors or simulators via Python 3 -- with results displayed courtesy of the 8x8 LED array on a SenseHat (or SenseHat emulator)!

Developed by Kevin Roche [GitHub: KPRoche/quantum-raspberry-tie](https://github.com/KPRoche/quantum-raspberry-tie)

## GHZ with multiple Qubits

This demo creates several blocks with multi-Qubit GHZ states and displays the result using the integrated LED. Simple circutis with up to 4*4*12=192 Qubits can be simulated.

## Fractals

Wiktor Mazin and a team have created fractals with some quantum input: [Fractal animations with quantum computing on a Raspberry Pi](https://medium.com/qiskit/fractal-animations-with-quantum-computing-on-a-raspberry-pi-8834ef43d423)


## Quantum Paradoxes


## Fun with Quantum

## Qoffee-Maker
